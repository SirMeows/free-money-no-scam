Case: FreeMoneyNoScam.dk

We are building a startup together! The startup is called FreeMoneyNoScam.dk
You can fork this repository: https://github.com/nicklasdean/free-money-no-scam.git

The first objective from our startup is collecting as many valid mail-addresses as possible
and saving them in a database (for very legal and ethical purposes).
We also need to confirm that the mail addresses are valid.
An e-mail validation service.
For the first iteration a valid e-mail contains a "@" an at least 1 "."
If the user enters a valid e-mail -
direct them to a success site.
Use the PRG pattern described on this site above

Exercise 2
Finish the FreeMoneyNoScam application with the following requirements fulfilled:
A user should be able to register their e-mail by a POST-request and a simple form
The e-mail should be saved in a database
A user should be able to see all registered e-mails on a separate template
